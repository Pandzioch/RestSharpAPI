For the testing purpose I used json-server from github project:
https://github.com/typicode/json-server for UnitTest1.cs file
https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md for fullSet.cs file

All request, no matter the method wes handled by the application.
For starting out, it needs NodeJS, db.json file configuration and any commandline

For all requests in this Project it's required that json-server is running.
